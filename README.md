This app demonstrates a modern Android architecture using:

- **Jetpack Compose** – for building a clean and declarative UI  
- **ViewModel** – to manage UI-related data and handle communication with the backend  
- **Dagger Hilt** – for dependency injection  
- **Room** – for local storage of basket data
